# UberTrak

[Play store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ubertrak.shockleyco.com.ubertrak2)

Adjustable-rate counter for tracking enemy ÃœberCharge and Kritz. During a competitive match, just leave your device running and the app will reflect whether or not the enemy medic has Uber based on your call outs

UberTrak V2 is the updated version with voice commands added. All phonetic recognition is handled on the device without any 3rd party services to eavesdrop on you. The only permission is storage for storing the phonetic library and application state!

Commands

  - Med Down: resets counter after 10 seconds
  - Med Popped: resets counter after 8 seconds
  - Reset Counter: resets counter immediately
  - Mom Get The Camera!!: fun little easter egg, resets immediately

#Information for Recruiters/ Hiring managers
Hi! This code was written years ago. I have recently reformatted it for continuation by other developers at their request, but there are plenty of 'noob mistakes' floating around in V2. I hope to come back to do a full refactor and port for iOS eventually, but for now I simply do not have the time while applying. I hope this shows the positive aspects of my love of software development and the community!

#Privacy updated
On February 8th, 2017 I received [an automated email from the Google Play Team](http://imgur.com/KOcSzVs) stating that UberTrak violates the User Data policy regarding Personal and Sensitive Information.

I should reiterate that this app produces zero traffic in and outbound the device. Whatever is picked up by your microphone lives and dies in memory, having never even been given the chance to make it out in the world.

I should reiterate that was the privacy policy and not a metaphor for life.
